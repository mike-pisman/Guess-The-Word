Game for Trijam #50

![](/GuessTheWord.gif)

It's a short game I made for Trijam #50. The game written in html/css/JS. The console part and script were made in 3 hours. The game features mini-game, copy of the game Pong, I wrote not too long ago for practice and decided to include as a bonus. I hope you enjoy it! Definitely try to play few times with different answers. 

The game captures your keyboard input and processes it on "enter". The pong uses mouse position.
